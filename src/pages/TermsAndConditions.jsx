        <p>
          This page details WingX’s Terms and Conditions of Use, or “Terms,”
          which is a contract between you and WingX. You are going to be legally
          bound by these Terms once you access, view or use the WingX website or
          mobile application (“WingX” or the “App”). The Terms constitute a
          binding legal agreement between you as user (“you”) and WingX LLC, a
          Massachusetts limited liability company (“we” or “us” or “the
          Company”). These Terms apply to anyone who accesses or uses our App,
          regardless of registration or subscription status.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your access and use of our App is also subject to the Privacy Policy,
          and any terms disclosed and agreed to by you when you purchase
          additional features, products, or services from WingX (“Additional
          Terms Upon Purchase”), which are incorporated into these Terms by
          reference. If you do not wish to be bound by these Terms, do not
          access or use our App.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify, amend, or change the Terms at any
          time. Notice of any material change will be posted on this page with
          an updated effective date. In certain circumstances, we may notify you
          of a change to the Terms via email or other means; however, you are
          responsible for regularly checking this page for any changes. Your
          continued access or use of our App constitutes your ongoing consent to
          any changes, and as a result, you will be legally bound by the updated
          Terms. If you do not accept a change to the Terms, you must stop
          accessing or using our App immediately.

          not responsible for the conduct of any user on or off the App.
          Communications received through the App, including automatic
          notifications sent by WingX, may result from users engaging with the
          App for improper purposes, including fraud, abuse, harassment, or

          and take appropriate safety precautions when communicating with or

          conduct – any criminal background check or other screenings (such as
          sex offender register searches) at any time using available public
          records, and you agree that any information you provide may be used
          for that purpose. If WingX decides to conduct any screening through a
          consumer reporting agency, you hereby authorize WingX to obtain and
          use a consumer report about you to determine your eligibility under
          these terms.

          “Member Content” refers to content that other users upload or provide
          while using our App. In these Terms, “Content” includes, without
          limitation, all text, images, video, audio, or other material on our
          App, including information on users’ profiles and in direct messages

        </p>
        <p>
          You do not have any rights in relation to Member Content, and, unless
          expressly authorized by WingX, you may only use Member Content to the
          extent that your use is consistent with our App’s purpose of allowing

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">8. Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          For information about how WingX collects, uses, and shares your
          personal data, please read our Privacy Policy. By using our App, you
          agree that we may use your personal data in accordance with our
          Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          For as long as you comply with these Terms, WingX grants you a
          personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive,
          revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use our App for
          purposes as intended by WingX and permitted by these Terms and
          applicable laws. This license and any authorization to access the App
          are automatically revoked in the event that you fail to comply with
          these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">10. Our Rights</h2>
        <p>
          By creating an account, you grant to WingX a worldwide, perpetual,
          transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free right and license to host,
          store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, translate,
          modify, reformat, incorporate into other works, advertise, distribute
          and otherwise make available to the general public Your Content,
          including any information you authorize us to access from Facebook or
          other third-party sources (if applicable), in whole or in part, and in
          any way and in any format or medium currently known or developed in
          the future. WingX’s license to Your Content shall be non-exclusive,
          except that WingX’s license shall be exclusive with respect to
          derivative works created through use of our App. For example, WingX
          would have an exclusive license to screenshots of our App that include
          Your Content.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, so that WingX can prevent the use of Your Content outside
          of our App, you authorize WingX to act on your behalf with respect to
          infringing uses of Your Content taken from our App by other users or
          third parties. This expressly includes the authority, but not the
          obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e.,
          DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if Your Content is taken and
          used by third parties outside of our App. WingX is not obligated to
          take any action with regard to use of Your Content by other users or
          third parties. WingX’s license to Your Content is subject to your
          rights under applicable law (for example, laws regarding personal data
          protection to the extent the content contains personal information as
          defined by those laws).
        </p>
        <p>
          In consideration for WingX allowing you to use our App, you agree that
          we and our third-party partners may place advertising on our App.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that WingX may access, preserve, and disclose your account
          information, including Your Content, if required to do so by law or
          upon a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure
          is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii)
          enforce these Terms; (iii) respond to claims that any content violates
          the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for
          customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal
          safety of the Company or any other person.
        </p>

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">11. Purchases</h2>
        <p>
          WingX may offer products and services for purchase through iTunes,
          Google Play or other external services authorized by WingX (each, an
          “External Service,” and any purchases made thereon, an “External
          Service Purchase”). WingX may also in the future offer products and
          services for purchase via credit card or other payment processors on
          the Website or inside the App (“Internal Purchases”). If you purchase
          a subscription, it will automatically renew until you cancel, in
          accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase, as
          further described below. If you cancel your subscription, you will
          continue to have access to your subscription benefits until the end of
          your subscription period, at which point it will expire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because our App may be utilized without a subscription, canceling your
          subscription does not remove your profile from our App. If you wish to
          fully terminate your membership, you must terminate your membership as
          set forth in Section 13.
        </p>
        <p>
          WingX operates a global business, and our pricing varies by a number
          of factors. We frequently offer promotional rates – which can vary
          based on region, length of subscription, bundle size and more. We also
          regularly test new features and payment options.
        </p>
        <p>
          When making a purchase on the App, you may have the option to pay
          through an External Service, such as with your Apple ID or Google Play
          account (“your External Service Account”), and your External Service
          Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms
          disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms
          applicable to your External Service Account. Some External Services
          may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live, which may
          change from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your External Service Purchase includes an automatically renewing
          subscription, your External Service Account will continue to be
          periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After your
          initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent
          subscription period, the subscription will automatically continue for
          the price and time period you agreed to when subscribing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you
          want to change or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your
          External Service Account and follow instructions to manage or cancel
          your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account
          with us or if you have deleted the App from your device. For example,
          if you subscribed using your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by
          Apple, not WingX. To cancel a purchase made with your Apple ID, go to
          Settings &gt; iTunes &amp; App Stores &gt; [click on your Apple ID]
          &gt; View Apple ID &gt; Subscriptions, then find your WingX
          subscription and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also
          request assistance at{" "}
          <a
            href="https://getsupport.apple.com"
            target="_blank"

          </a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, if you subscribed on Google Play, cancellation is handled
          by Google. To cancel a purchase made through Google Play, launch the
          Google Play app on your mobile device and go to Menu &gt; My Apps &gt;
          Subscriptions, then find your WingX subscription and follow the
          instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at{" "}
          <a
            href="https://play.google.com"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"

          >
            https://play.google.com
          </a>
          . If you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use the canceled
          service until the end of your then-current subscription term. The
          subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with
          your External Service Account, WingX may terminate your account
          immediately at its sole discretion. WingX will retain all funds
          charged to your External Service Account until you cancel your
          subscription through your External Service Account. Certain users may
          be entitled to request a refund. See Section 12 below for more
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Virtual Item(s)” offer the opportunity to purchase a limited,
          personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to
          use or access special limited-use features from WingX. You may only
          purchase Virtual Items from us through our App. Virtual Items
          represent a limited license right governed by these Terms, and, except
          as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, no title or ownership in or
          to Virtual Items is being transferred or assigned to you. These Terms
          should not be construed as a sale of any rights in Virtual Items.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a
          real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead
          constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. Virtual Items
          do not incur fees for non-use; however, the license granted to you in
          Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with these Terms, on the
          earlier of when WingX ceases providing our App services, or your
          account is otherwise closed or terminated.
        </p>
        <p>
          WingX, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for
          the right to access or use Virtual Items and/or may distribute Virtual
          Items with or without charge. WingX may manage, regulate, control,
          modify, or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, including taking
          actions that may impact the perceived value or purchase price, if
          applicable, of any Virtual Items. WingX shall have no liability to you
          or any third party in the event that WingX exercises any such rights.
          The transfer of Virtual Items is prohibited, and you shall not sell,
          redeem, or otherwise transfer Virtual Items to any person or entity.
          Virtual Items may only be redeemed through our App.
        </p>
        <p>
          All purchases and redemptions of Virtual Items made through our App
          are final and non-refundable. You acknowledge that WingX is not
          required to provide a refund for any reason, and that you will not
          receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items when an
          account is closed, whether it was closed voluntarily or involuntarily.
        </p>

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">12. Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Generally, all purchases are final and nonrefundable, and there are no
          refunds or credits for partially used periods, except if the laws
          applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.
        </p>
        <p>
          For subscribers residing in the EU, EEA, UK, and Switzerland: In
          accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund during
          the 14 days after the subscription begins. Please note that this
          14-day period commences when the subscription starts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For subscribers residing in Arizona, California, Colorado,
          Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina,
          Ohio, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin: You may cancel your subscription,
          without penalty or obligation, at any time prior to midnight of the
          third business day following the date you subscribed. In the event
          that you die before the end of your subscription period, your estate
          shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had
          made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your
          death. In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable
          to use our App) before the end of your subscription period, you shall
          be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made
          for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your
          disability by providing the Company notice in the same manner as you
          request a refund as described below.
        </p>
        <p>Purchases of Virtual Items are final and non-refundable.</p>
        <p>
          If any of the above apply to you and you subscribed using your Apple
          ID, your refund requests are handled by Apple, not WingX. To request a
          refund, please contact your External Service directly; for example
          using your Apple device, go to Settings &gt; iTunes &amp; App Stores
          &gt; [click on your Apple ID] &gt; View Apple ID &gt; Purchase
          History. Find the transaction and select “Report a Problem.” You can
          also request a refund at{" "}

          >
            https://getsupport.apple.com
          </a>
          . For any other purchase, please contact WingX Customer Service by
          e-mailing a dated notice to{" "}
          <a href="mailto:legal@wingxapp.com" className="email-red">

          which states that you, the buyer, are canceling these Terms, or words
          of a similar effect. Please also include the email address or
          telephone number associated with your account.
        </p>

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">13. Account Termination</h2>
        <p>
          You can delete your account at any time by logging into the App, going
          to the “Profile” tab, and selecting “Settings & Privacy” (the gear
          icon), clicking “Delete Account,” and following the instructions to
          terminate your membership. However, you will need to cancel / manage
          any External Service Purchases through your External Service Account
          (e.g., iTunes, Google Play) to avoid additional billing.
        </p>
        <p>
          WingX reserves the right to investigate and, if appropriate, suspend
          or terminate your account without a refund if WingX believes that you
          have violated these Terms, misused our App, or behaved in a way that
          WingX regards as inappropriate or unlawful, on or off our App. We
          reserve the right to make use of any personal, technological, legal,
          or other means available to enforce the Terms, at any time without
          liability and without the obligation to give you prior notice,
          including, but not limited to, preventing you from accessing the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your account is terminated by you or by WingX for any reason, these
          Terms continue and remain enforceable between you and WingX, and you
          will not be entitled to any refund for purchases made. Your
          information will be maintained and deleted in accordance with our
          Privacy Policy.

          with the services; or (iii) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of
          your content, even if WingX has been advised of the possibility of
          such damages. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no
          event will WingX’s aggregate liability to you for all claims relating
          to the services exceed the amount paid, if any, by you to WingX for
          the services during the twenty-four (24) month period immediately
          preceding the date that you first file a lawsuit, arbitration or any
          other legal proceeding against WingX, whether statutory, in law or in
          equity, in any tribunal. The damages limitation set forth in the
          immediately preceding sentence applies (i) regardless of the ground
          upon which liability is based (whether default, contract, tort,
          statute, or otherwise), (ii) irrespective of the type of breach of
          rights, privileges, or obligations, and (iii) with respect to all
          events, the service, and this agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The limitation of liability provisions set forth in this section shall
          apply even if your remedies under this agreement fail with respect to
          their essential purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain
          damages, so some or all of the exclusions and limitations in this
          section may not apply to you.

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">18. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          This “Arbitration Agreement” henceforth described in this Dispute
          Resolution Section applies to any disputes or claims of any kind
          whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, statute, regulation,
          ordinance, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal or equitable
          theory) between you and WingX (the “Parties”, or individually,
          “Party”) arising out of or relating to the Terms, prior versions of
          the Terms, your use of our App, or any other aspect of your
          relationship with WingX, including claims or disputes arising (but not
          actually filed in arbitration) before the effective date of these
          Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent allowable by law, you and WingX each waive the
          right to a jury trial and the right to litigate disputes in court in
          favor of individual arbitration (except for small claims court as
          provided above). You and WingX each waive the right to file or
          participate in a class action against the other or otherwise to seek
          relief on a class basis, including any currently pending actions
          against WingX. To the fullest extent allowable by law, there shall be
          no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or litigated on
          a class, collective, representative, consolidated, or private attorney
          general basis. The arbitrator can award the same relief available in
          court provided that the arbitrator may only award final relief
          (including injunctive or declaratory relief) in favor of the
          individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
          provide final relief warranted by that individual party’s claim. The
          arbitrator may not award final relief for, against, or on behalf of
          anyone who is not a party to the arbitration on a class, collective,
          representative, or private attorney general basis. If a court
          determines that any of these prohibitions in this paragraph are
          unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as
          a request for public injunctive relief), and all appeals of that
          decision are exhausted or the decision is otherwise final, then you
          and WingX agree that that particular claim or request for relief shall
          proceed in court but shall be stayed pending individual arbitration of
          the remaining claims for relief that you have brought. If this
          specific paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of
          this arbitration provision (except for the jury trial waiver and the
          informal dispute resolution process) shall be null and void. This
          paragraph is an essential part of this arbitration agreement.

        <p>
          Any part of this Dispute Resolution Section that is prohibited by law
          shall not apply to the users residing in that jurisdiction, for

          so we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside
          assistance. If you choose to pursue a dispute, claim or controversy
          against WingX, these terms will apply. For purposes of this Dispute
          Resolution Process and Arbitration Procedures set forth in this
          section, “WingX” shall include our affiliates, employees, licensors,
          and service providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice of Dispute and Informal Resolution: Before formally pursuing a
          Dispute in arbitration or small claims court, you agree to first send
          a detailed notice (“Notice”) to{" "}
          <a href="mailto:legal@wingxapp.com" className="blueanchor">
            legal@wingxapp.com
          </a>
          . Similarly, if WingX has a Dispute with you, WingX agrees to first
          send a Notice to you at your most recent email address on file with
          us, or if no email address is on file, other contact information
          associated with your account. Your Notice must contain all of the
          following information: (1) your full name; (2) information that
          enables WingX to identify your account, including a picture or
          screenshot of your profile, your address, mobile phone number, email
          address, and date of birth you used to register your account if any;
          and (3) a detailed description of your Dispute, including the nature
          and factual basis of your claim(s) and the relief you are seeking with
          a corresponding calculation of your alleged damages (if any). You must
          personally sign this Notice for it to be effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          WingX’s Notice must likewise set forth a detailed description of its
          Dispute, which shall include the nature and factual basis of its
          claim(s) and the relief it is seeking, with a corresponding
          calculation of our damages (if any). You and WingX agree to then
          negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute. As part
          of these good faith negotiations, if WingX requests a telephone
          conference with you to discuss your Dispute, you agree to personally
          participate, with your attorney if you’re represented by counsel.
          Likewise, if you request a telephone conference to discuss WingX’s
          Dispute with you, WingX agrees to have one representative participate.
          This informal process should lead to a resolution of the Dispute.
          However, if the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt
          of a fully completed Notice and the Parties have not otherwise
          mutually agreed to an extension of this informal dispute resolution
          time period, you or WingX may initiate an arbitration (subject to a
          Party’s right to elect small claims court as provided below).
        </p>
        <p>
          Completion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition
          precedent to filing any demand for arbitration or small claims court
          action. Failure to do so is a breach of these Terms. The statute of
          limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while you and
          WingX engage in this informal dispute resolution process. Unless
          prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider, National
          Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), shall not accept or administer any
          demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any
          arbitration unless the Party bringing such demand for arbitration can
          certify in writing that the terms and conditions of this informal
          dispute resolution process were fully satisfied. A court of competent
          jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to
          enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Binding Individual Arbitration: Any dispute, claim, or controversy
          between you and WingX that is not resolved informally by WingX
          Customer Service or as described above that arises from or relates in
          any way to these Terms (including any alleged breach of these Terms),
          the App, or our relationship with you (collectively, “Dispute”), shall
          be exclusively resolved through Binding Individual Arbitration except
          as specifically provided otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section.
          “Dispute” as used in these Terms shall have the broadest possible
          meaning and include claims that arose before the existence of this or
          any prior Terms and claims that arise during the term of these Terms
          or after the termination of these Terms. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, either you or WingX may elect to have an individual claim
          heard in small claims court. If the request to proceed in small claims
          court is made after an arbitration has been initiated but before an
          arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be
          administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s
          jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. All other
          issues (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for the
          Arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to scope and
          enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section, as well as any
          request to proceed in small claims court that is made after an
          arbitrator has been appointed. If you or WingX challenges the small
          claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent
          jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is
          unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from these Terms as
          to your Dispute. However, such court determination shall not be
          considered or deemed binding with respect to WingX’s other contracting
          parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Disputes that are submitted to NAM after fully completing the
          Notice of Dispute and Informal Resolution process described above and
          when no small claims court election is made by either Party, any
          arbitration between you and WingX shall be administered by NAM in
          accordance with NAM’s operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules
          and Procedures (the “NAM Rules”) in effect at the time any demand for
          arbitration is filed with NAM, as modified by this Dispute Resolution
          Section. For a copy of the NAM Rules, please visit{" "}

          . If NAM is unable or unwilling to perform its duties under these
          Terms, the parties shall mutually agree on an alternative
          administrator that will replace NAM and assume NAM’s role consistent
          with these Terms. If the parties are unable to agree, they will
          petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator
          that will assume NAM’s duties under these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Parties agree that the following procedures will apply to any
          Arbitrations initiated under this Dispute Resolution Section:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Commencing an Arbitration</strong> – To initiate an
            arbitration, you or WingX shall send to NAM a demand for arbitration
            (“Demand for Arbitration”) that describes the claim(s) and request
            for relief in detail, consistent with the requirements in these
            Terms and NAM Rules. If you send a Demand for Arbitration, you shall
            also send it to WingX at{" "}
            <a href="mailto:legal@wingxapp.com" className="blueanchor">
              legal@wingxapp.com
            </a>{" "}
            within 10 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to NAM. If
            WingX sends a Demand for Arbitration, we will also send it to your
            mailing address on file with us within the same 10-day period. If
            your mailing address is unavailable, we will send it to your email
            address on file, or if no email address is on file, other contact
            information associated with your account. The arbitration provider
            shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall
            administratively close any such demand for arbitration that fails to
            certify in writing that the Party meets the requirements of Dispute
            Resolution Section 18 or if either Party elects small claims court
            as set forth above.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fees</strong> – The payment of all fees shall be governed by
            the NAM Rules, except to the extent that the case is a part of a
            Mass Filing (as defined below) or the NAM fees and costs (including
            Arbitrator fees) paid by either Party are reallocated upon order of
            the Arbitrator following a determination that (a) either Party
            breached Section 18 of these Terms, (b) such reallocation is called
            for under these Terms, or (c) reallocation is otherwise permitted
            under applicable law. Upon showing WingX of your financial hardship
            we will consider a good faith request made by you to pay your
            portion of the applicable consumer portion of the filing fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Arbitrator</strong> – The arbitration shall be conducted
            by a single, neutral arbitrator (the “Claim Arbitrator”), as
            assisted by any Process Arbitrator appointed under NAM Rules. (The
            term “Arbitrator” applies to both the Claim Arbitrator and the
            Process Arbitrator). If a hearing is elected by either Party, the
            Arbitrator shall be in or close to the location in which you reside.
            The Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to these Terms. In the
            event NAM Rules conflict with these Terms, these Terms shall
            control. If the Arbitrator determines that strict application of any
            term of Section 18 of these Terms (except for the small claims
            election, which shall be determined by the small claims court) would
            result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration (the “Unfair Term”),
            then the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair Term
            to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration
            that is consistent with the Terms of Use (the “Modified Term”). In
            determining the substance of a Modified Term, the Arbitrator shall
            select a term that comes closest to expressing the intention of the
            Unfair Term.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dispositive Motions</strong> – The Parties agree that the
            Claim Arbitrator shall have the authority to consider dispositive
            motions without an oral evidentiary hearing. Dispositive motions may
            be requested under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days
            after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment, a Party may request to
            file a dispositive motion based upon the pleadings; and (b) no later
            than 30 days prior to the evidentiary hearing, a Party may request
            to file a dispositive motion for summary judgment based upon the
            Parties’ pleadings and the evidence submitted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Discovery</strong> – Each Party may (a) serve up to five
            requests for relevant, non-privileged documents from the other
            Party; and (b) request that the other Party provide verified
            responses to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including
            subparts). Unless both Parties agree otherwise, no other forms of
            discovery (including depositions) may be utilized. Any such
            discovery requests must be served on the other Party within 21 days
            after the Claim Arbitrator’s appointment. The responding Party shall
            provide the requesting Party with all responsive, non-privileged
            documents, responses signed by the Party themselves to the requested
            interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests within 30
            days after receipt of the requests, or, in the event of an objection
            to any discovery request, 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator
            resolves the dispute. In the event either Party requests that the
            Claim Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings,
            such written discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30
            days following the Claim Arbitrator’s final decision on such
            dispositive motion. Any disputes about discovery or requests for
            extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Claim Arbitrator for
            resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request,
            the Claim Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature,
            amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and
            other effort that would be involved in providing the requested
            discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is
            necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confidentiality</strong> – Upon either Party’s request, the
            Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential
            information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration
            (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except
            in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the
            arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of
            confidential information must be done under seal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Arbitration Hearing</strong> – You and WingX are entitled to
            a fair evidentiary hearing (i.e. trial) before the Claim Arbitrator.
            Arbitration proceedings are usually simpler, less costly, and more
            streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. The Parties
            agree to waive all oral hearings and instead submit all disputes to
            the Claim Arbitrator for an award based on written submissions and
            other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party requests an
            oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondent files a response.
            If an oral evidentiary hearing is requested, both Parties must be
            personally present at the hearing, regardless of whether either
            Party has retained counsel. Both Parties must personally attend the
            hearing. Either Party’s failure to personally attend the hearing,
            without a continuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for good
            cause, will result in a default judgment taken against that Party.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Arbitration Award</strong> – Regardless of the format of the
            arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall provide a reasoned decision,
            in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing is
            held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements
            are due. The decision must clearly specify the relief, if any,
            awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award.
            The arbitration award is binding only between you and WingX and will
            not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding
            that involves a different Party. The Claim Arbitrator may, however,
            choose to consider rulings from other arbitrations involving a
            different Party. The Arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided
            by the NAM Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be
            awarded in court. This includes but is not limited to the ability of
            the Arbitrator to award fees and costs if the Arbitrator determines
            that a claim or defense is frivolous or was brought for an improper
            purpose, for the purpose of harassment, or in bad faith.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Offer of Settlement</strong> – The Respondent may, but is
            not obligated to, make a written settlement offer to the opposing
            Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive
            motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted.
            The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to
            the Claim Arbitrator until after the Claim Arbitrator issues an
            award on the claim. If the award is issued in the opposing Party’s
            favor and is less than the Respondent’s settlement offer or if the
            award is in the Respondent’s favor, the opposing Party must pay the
            Respondent’s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any
            attorney’s fees. If any applicable statute or caselaw prohibits the
            flipping of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in
            this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs
            that claimant may be entitled to for the cause of action under which
            it is suing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mass Filing</strong> – If, at any time, 25 or more similar
            demands for arbitration are asserted against WingX or related
            parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (“Mass
            Filing”), consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass
            Filings set forth in the NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute
            Resolution Rules and Procedures (“NAM’s Mass Filing Rules”,
            available at{" "}

            ), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply.
            <ol type="i">
              <li>
                If you or your counsel file a Demand for Arbitration that fits
                within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you
                agree that your Demand for Arbitration shall be subject to the
                additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection.
                You also acknowledge that the adjudication of your Dispute might
                be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall
                be tolled from the time at which the first cases are chosen to
                proceed until your case is chosen for a bellwether proceeding.
              </li>
              <li>
                NAM’s Mass Filing Rules shall apply if your Dispute is deemed by
                NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to its Rules and this
                Dispute Resolution Section, to be part of a Mass Filing. Such
                election for NAM’s Mass Filing Rules and related fee schedule
                must be made by either you or WingX in writing and submitted to
                NAM and all Parties.
              </li>
              <li>
                Bellwether Proceedings. Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by
                courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple
                disputes involving similar claims against the same or related
                parties. Counsel for the Mass Filings claimants (including you)
                and counsel for WingX shall each select 15 Demands for
                Arbitration (30 total), and no more than 30 arbitrations shall
                be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending at the same time,
                with each of the 30 individual arbitrations presided over by a
                different Claim Arbitrator, in a first set of bellwether
                proceedings. During this time, no other Demands for arbitration
                that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed,
                adjudicated, or pending. If the Parties are unable to resolve
                the remaining Demands for Arbitration after the first set of
                bellwether proceedings are arbitrated or otherwise resolved,
                then counsel for the Claimants and counsel for WingX shall each
                select an additional 15 Demands for Arbitration (30) total to be
                filed, processed, and adjudicated as individual arbitrations,
                with each of the 30 arbitrations presided over by a different
                Claim Arbitrator, in a second set of bellwether proceedings.
                During this time, no other Demands for Arbitration that are part
                of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated.
                This staged process of bellwether proceedings, with each set
                including 30 Demands for Arbitration adjudicated on an
                individual basis, shall continue until each Demand included in
                the Mass Filings (including your Demand for Arbitration) is
                adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Fees associated with a Demand
                for Arbitration included in the Mass Filings, including fees
                owed by WingX and the claimants (including you), shall only be
                due after your Demand for Arbitration is chosen as part of a set
                of bellwether proceedings and therefore properly designated for
                filing, processing, and adjudication. Any applicable statute of
                limitations shall be tolled beginning when you initiate the
                informal dispute resolution process set forth at the beginning
                of this Section 18, and if the first Mass Filings’ Demands for
                Arbitration are chosen for the initial set of bellwether
                proceedings have been filed, your claims will remain tolled
                until your Demand for Arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is
                settled. A court of competent jurisdiction located in a venue
                allowed under Section 20 of the Agreement shall have the power
                to enforce this subsection.
              </li>
              <li>
                You and WingX agree that we each value the integrity and
                efficiency of the arbitration and small claims court process and
                wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine
                and sincere disputes between us. You and WingX acknowledge and
                agree to act in good faith to ensure the fair resolution of
                genuine and sincere Disputes. The Parties further agree that
                application of these Mass Filings procedures have been
                reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair
                adjudication of such cases.

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">19. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent allowable by law, the laws of Massachusetts,
          United States of America, without regard to its conflict of laws
          rules, shall apply to any Dispute arising out of or relating to these
          Terms or our Services. For the avoidance of doubt, for users residing
          outside of the United States, the choice of Massachusetts governing
          law shall not supersede any mandatory consumer protection legislation
          in the jurisdiction where you resided at the time you accepted these
          Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Dispute Resolution Process
          set forth in Section 18 shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
          Act.
        </p>

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">20. Forum Selection</h2>
        <p>
          Except where prohibited by law, including for users residing in the
          EU, EEA, UK or Switzerland, who may bring claims in their country of
          residence in accordance with applicable law, and except for claims
          that are heard in a small claims court as set forth in Section 18, any
          claims arising out of or relating to these Terms, to our Services, or
          to your relationship with WingX that for whatever reason are not
          required to be arbitrated or filed in small claims court, will be
          litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts located in
          Suffolk County, Massachusetts, United States of America. You and WingX
          consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts in the
          State of Massachusetts and waive any claim that such courts constitute
          an inconvenient forum.
        </p>

        <h2 className="privacy-subheading">21. Indemnity By You</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify, defend, release, and hold us, and our

        <p>
          By using our Services, whether through a mobile device, mobile
          application, or computer, you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms,
          which we may amend from time to time, (ii) our Privacy Policy, and
          (iii) any Additional Terms Upon Purchase. If you do not accept and

          These Terms, along with the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms
          Upon Purchase, contain the entire agreement between you and WingX
          regarding the use of our Services. The Terms supersede all previous
          agreements, representations, and arrangements between us, written or
          oral. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, illegal, or
          otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms shall continue in
          full force and effect. The failure of the Company to exercise or
          enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a
          waiver of such right or provision.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that your WingX account is non-transferable and all of your
